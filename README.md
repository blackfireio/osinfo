OS Info
=======

This package provides a cross-platform way to identify the hardware your go code is running on.

The following fields are provided by the `OSInfo` struct:

| Field        | Description                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Family       | The OS type as defined by `GOOS`        |
| Architecture | The architecture as defined by `GOARCH` |
| ID           | The OS ID as defined by the OS          |
| Name         | The OS name as defined by the OS        |
| Codename     | The release codename (if any)           |
| Version      | The release version                     |
| Build        | The build number (if any)               |

Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------

The following operating systems are currently supported:

- Linux
- FreeBSD
- macOS
- Windows

If you wish to see another operating system supported (provided it is in
[this list](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/go/build/syslist.go)),
please open a pull request with the necessary changes and tests.
Use one of the existing `getOSInfoXYZ()` functions as a guide (most commonly
it involves parsing the output from a command or file).

Usage
-----

```golang
	info, err := osinfo.GetOSInfo()
	if err != nil {
		// TODO: Handle this
	}

	fmt.Printf("Family:       %v\n", info.Family)
	fmt.Printf("Architecture: %v\n", info.Architecture)
	fmt.Printf("ID:           %v\n", info.ID)
	fmt.Printf("Name:         %v\n", info.Name)
	fmt.Printf("Codename:     %v\n", info.Codename)
	fmt.Printf("Version:      %v\n", info.Version)
	fmt.Printf("Build:        %v\n", info.Build)
	fmt.Printf("IsWSL:        %t\n", info.IsWSL)
```
